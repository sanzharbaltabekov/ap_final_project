Idea proposal:

	Problem or idea description
		Our idea is to write a code that will take an emotion of a person that wants to watch the film based on the emotion this person showed. We most probably will do it all 		in Google Colab but we also will try to create a mobile app that will have a camera function in it for taking photos of four basic human emotions such as happiness, 			anger, fear, sadness etc and taking it as an input and obviously code that will solve it and output the film genre (most probably it will send photo to Google Colab for 		it to analyze an emotion).
	Background information on the problem or idea:
		The idea involves developing a code that analyzes human emotions, detected through images captured by a mobile app's camera, to recommend films matching the user's 			mood. Emotions such as happiness, anger, fear, and sadness will be recognized. This process will likely be implemented using Google Colab for analysis. The background 			lies in catering to diverse emotional states of users seeking entertainment, enhancing their film selection experience through personalized recommendations. The goal is 		to create a seamless interface between emotion recognition technology and film genre classification, ultimately enhancing user satisfaction and engagement.
	Available solutions with links
		We did our small research to find available solutions for our idea and as a result we found some:
			- Emotion Detection using CNN | Emotion Detection Deep Learning project |Machine Learning | Data Magic (youtube.com)
			- Face Emotion Recognition Using Machine Learning | Python (youtube.com)
	How to get the data?
		We will most probably create our own dataset of emotions in order to train our code's vision so it successfully distinguishes them but we also may take a ready dataset 		and use it.
	Brief description of your solution
		We will train the machine to recognize emotions from photos with our datasets. We will write an algorithm for recognizing it that will accept the data given by a 			trained machine from a photo. And the person will get the right film based on genre.
	Tech stack that will be used
		Python, TF or Pytorch. We will most likely use PyTorch because our project does not require advanced Tensorflow tools and PyTorch is more flexible in our opinion. Also 		Google Colab and Google Drive for obvious reasons. Maybe some stuff to quickly make a simple mobile app if we decide to make one like Flutter.
	Any information you find necessary
		We have nothing to add.
